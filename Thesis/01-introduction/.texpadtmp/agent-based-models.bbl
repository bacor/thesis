  Models of language evolution have demonstrated how aspects of human language,
  such as compositionality, can arise in populations of interacting agents.
  This paper analyzes how languages change as the result of a particular form
  of interaction: agents learning from one another. We show that, when the
  learners are rational Bayesian agents, this process of iterated learning
  converges to the prior distribution over languages assumed by those learners.
  The rate of convergence is set by the amount of information conveyed by the
  data seen by each generation; the less informative the data, the faster the
  process converges to the prior.%

  Models of categorization make different representational assumptions, with

  We introduce an experimental paradigm for studying the cumulative cultural
  evolution of language. In doing so we provide the first experimental
  validation for the idea that cultural transmission can lead to the appearance
  of design without a designer. Our experiments involve the iterated learning
  of artificial languages by human participants. We show that languages
  transmitted culturally evolve in such a way as to maximize their own
  transmissibility: over time, the languages in our experiments become easier
  to learn and increasingly structured. Furthermore, this structure emerges
  purely as a consequence of the transmission of language over generations,
  without any intentional design on the part of individual language learners.
  Previous computational and mathematical models suggest that iterated learning
  provides an explanation for the structure of human language and link
  particular aspects of linguistic structure with particular constraints acting
  on language during its transmission. The experimental work presented here
  shows that the predictions of these models, and models of cultural evolution
  more generally, can be tested in the laboratory.%

  Human language arises from biological evolution, individual learning, and
  cultural transmission, but the interaction of these three processes has not
  been widely studied. We set out a formal framework for analyzing cultural
  transmission, which allows us to investigate how innate learning biases are
  related to universal properties of language. We show that cultural
  transmission can magnify weak biases into strong linguistic universals,
  undermining one of the arguments for strong innate constraints on language
  learning. As a consequence, the strength of innate biases can be shielded
  from natural selection, allowing these genes to drift. Furthermore, even when
  there is no natural selection, cultural transmission can produce apparent
  adaptations. Cultural transmission thus provides an alternative to
  traditional nativist and adaptationist explanations for the properties of
  human languages.%

  Previous analytic results (Griffiths {\&} Kalish, 2007) show that repeated
  learning and transmission of languages in populations of Bayesian learners
  results in distributions of languages which directly reflect the biases of
  learners. This result potentially has profound implications for our
  understanding of the link between the human language learning apparatus and
  the dis- tribution of languages in the world. It is shown here that a
  variation on these models (such that learners learn from the linguistic
  behaviour of multiple individuals, rather than a sin- gle individual) changes
  this transparent relationship between learning bias and typology. This
  suggests that inferring learn- ing bias from typology (or population
  behaviour from labora- tory diffusion chains) is potentially unsafe.%

  Why are languages the way they are? The biases and constraints that explain
  why languages display the traits they do—instead of other possible
  ones—include human cognition, social dynamics, communicative function, the
  structure of meanings, and the interactions between these. Cultural language
  evolution is concerned with explaining the causal pathways that link these
  biases and constraints with fundamental linguistic traits, such as
  combinatoriality, compositionality, conventionality, and arbitrariness. The
  cultural evolution of language, or the emergence of a language from no
  language, begins when motivated signals are used in context by individuals
  who do not share a means of communication. Repeated interaction between
  interlocutors makes individual signals compressible through reduction or
  simplification and can entrench idiosyncratic patterns. Transmission to new
  learners results in the increasing compressibility at the level of the system
  through the introduction of categories and regular rules, and in the spread
  of conventional, arbitrary signals.%
