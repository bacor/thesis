  \field{abstract}{%
  Social conventions govern countless behaviors all of us engage in every day,
  from how we greet each other to the languages we speak. But how can shared
  conventions emerge spontaneously in the absence of a central coordinating
  authority? The Naming Game model shows that networks of locally interacting
  individuals can spontaneously self-organize to produce global coordination.
  Here, we provide a gentle introduction to the main features of the model,
  from the dynamics observed in homogeneously mixing populations to the role
  played by more complex social networks, and to how slight modifications of
  the basic interaction rules give origin to a richer phenomenology in which
  more conventions can co-exist indefinitely.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A strong constraint on the arithmetical combinations allowed in compound
  numerals, called the Packing Strategy, applies very widely to numeral systems
  across the world. A previous attempt to explain the existence of the strong
  universal constraint, in terms of a gradual socio-historical process of
  standardization, will not scale up to higher-valued numerals. It is proposed
  that the real explanation for the Packing Strategy is that it reflects two
  natural principles applied in the practical task of counting objects. These
  two principles, "Go as far as you can with the resources you have", and
  "Minimize the number of entities you are dealing with", are not specific to
  the counting task, but are of more general application to practical tasks. ??
